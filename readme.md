## TO DO:

### UX
- [x] Link to album page from tracks
- [ ] Load tracks + audio for albums
- [ ] Truncate long titles in mobile headers
- [ ] Offer compact views of items
- [ ] Make page limits configurable
- [ ] Scroll-to-load on paged content

### Tech debt
- [ ] Remove `/track/:id` endpoint
- [ ] Relax `processTrack` requirements: Pick<{...required}>
- [ ] Album: Use CSS counter to display track numbers against names

### DX        
- [ ] Switch to Snowpack
- [ ] Use query params to drive paging

### Perfomance:
- [ ] Create a `use:onload` action for fading in lazy-loaded images
- [ ] Investigate `content-visibility`
