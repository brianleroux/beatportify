## TO DO:

### UX
- [x] Link to album page from tracks
- [ ] Load tracks + audio for albums
- [ ] Fix missing playlists at boot
- [ ] Underline artist links
- [ ] Truncate long titles in mobile headers
- [ ] TrackList: Offer compact views of items
- [ ] TrackList: Make sortable via derived store
- [ ] Paging: Make page limits configurable
- [ ] Paging: Scroll-to-load on paged content
- [ ] Album: Use CSS counter to display track numbers against names AND/OR create `albumIndex`?
- [ ] Album: Don't repeat cover image per track

#### Stretch
- [ ] Use Spotify Connect to highlight playing track

### Tech debt
- [ ] Remove `/track/:id` endpoint
- [ ] Relax `processTrack` requirements: Pick<{...required}>

### DX        
- [ ] Work out how to attach a debugger
- [ ] Switch to Snowpack
- [ ] Use query params to drive paging

### Perfomance:
- [ ] Create a `use:onload` action for fading in lazy-loaded images
- [ ] Investigate `content-visibility`
